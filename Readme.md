# KPCA

This is a realization of Kernel Principle Component Analysis (KPCA) and its applications (Code + Description). Here is the file structure:

```
KPCA
    |-- src
        |-- myarrow.m
        |-- mygenerate_data.m
        |-- mykernel.m
        |-- myKPCA.m
        |-- myPCA.m
        |-- PCAKPCA_test.m
    |-- LICENSE
    |-- Readme.md
    |-- 学习笔记 _ 核主成分分析(KPCA)及其若干应用.md
```
Among the files above:
- file 'myarrow.m' is a function to draw arrows in MATLAB programmed by me myself;
- file 'mygenerate_data.m' is a function to generated a toy dataset;
- file 'mykernel.m' is a function to calculate kernel;
- file 'myPCA.m' is a function to realize KPCA by me myself;
- file 'myPCA.m' is a function to realize PCA by me myself;
- file 'PCAKPCA_test.m' is a test file to examine the performance of KPCA and compare the difference between PCA and KPCA;
- file 'LICENSE' is the license file produced by github;
- file '学习笔记 _ 主成分分析(PCA)及其若干应用.md' is a detailed introduction document for this project.
